## Managed Cloud Services

Sometimes, an organization will outsource their cloud system management. This is called a **managed cloud service**.

In a managed cloud service, a third-party manages some or all of an organization’s cloud resources and infrastructure to ensure the system runs smoothly.

For example, Salesforce is a Software as a Service (SaaS) tool that helps retailers manage their online storefronts — it is a managed cloud service.

Managed cloud services are part of a company’s larger cloud ecosystem and need to be considered when planning cloud deployments.
